# Application-Send Turn Local Campaign Evidence — 2026-07-23

Status: retained local evidence only. The first three cells are
`invalid_environment`; the corrected fourth cell is `neutral_local` on a
limited same-host topology. None is eligible for policy acceptance, rule
derivation, shadow verification, ProtocolLab submission, or activation.

## Scope

- Axis: `application_send_turn_planning`.
- Treatments: forced `legacy_current` and forced `conservative` in ABBA order.
- Adjacent axes: legacy/current; the receive-credit environment variable was
  reported as `unset` by every raw server host.
- Runtime source commit: `a670c66d88b826420191ef40b66f5cafe72ff9cf`.
- Campaign commit after the exporter correction: `b50daee8`.
- Command: `Invoke-AdaptiveRuntimePolicyLocalCell.ps1` with
  `-CampaignId adaptive-send-turn-local-20260723-c1-abba`,
  `-CellId duplex-64kb-x1-s16`,
  `-PolicyAxis application_send_turn_planning`, `-SequenceProtocol ABBA`,
  `-PolicyA legacy_current`, `-PolicyB conservative`, one connection, sixteen
  streams per connection, two-second warmup, and five-second measurement.

## Retained Artifacts And Classification

The complete retained root is
`C:\shared\src\incursa\quic-dotnet\.artifacts\adaptive-runtime\adaptive-send-turn-local-20260723-c1-abba\duplex-64kb-x1-s16`.

| Item | Count / value | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ABBA samples | 4 | All exact-payload valid; no failed, timed-out, or protocol-error operations. |
| Raw construction records | 8 | Two versioned connection records per sample; forced identity matches each sample treatment. |
| Local-result classification | `invalid_environment` | Same-host target/generator health was invalid and maximum within-treatment relative range was `0.05650001823266077`, above the five-percent bound. |
| Original exporter output | 0 rows | Preserved empty `construction-rows` directory from the argument-expansion failure. |
| Diagnostic export | 2 rows | Preserved under `construction-rows.export-001`; excluded from the correction join to avoid duplicate identities. |
| Corrected construction export | 8 rows | Preserved under each sample's `construction-rows.export-002` directory. |
| Corrected validation | valid | 8 unique construction rows, one checksum inventory, 44 verified artifacts; summary SHA-256 `27259465a443a56ab9122a2715e372c5f831d612f060b1c3b02ba7b6cd09d513`. |

The first runner attempt exposed two retained implementation defects: multiple
exclusion flags were passed as one comma-delimited value, and a successful
PowerShell exporter could be mistaken for failure when `$LASTEXITCODE` was
unset. `b50daee8` corrects the first defect and `d262bd08` corrects the
second before another campaign is started. The raw run, empty output, duplicate diagnostic rows,
and validated `export-002` correction remain preserved rather than replaced.

## Dataset Disposition

- Raw layer: retain all sixteen samples and all thirty-two source records
  across the original cell and all three reruns.
- Construction-provenance layer: retain the original eight `export-002` rows
  with `target_health_invalid` and `generator_health_invalid` exclusions, and
  the eight automatically exported `rerun-004` rows. The two original
  diagnostic rows remain outside the correction join to avoid duplicate
  identities.
- Curated and analysis layers: zero included rows. The invalid rows remain
  excluded; the `neutral_local` rows remain uncurated until independent-host,
  fairness, and managed-allocation gates are populated.
- No benchmark claim, threshold tuning, rule proposal, shadow conclusion, or
  active-policy recommendation follows from any of these runs.

## Subsequent Retained Reruns

Each rerun retained its own root, command output, source commit, raw records,
and classification. They are not pooled with one another or with a future
independent-host cohort.

| Campaign | Runtime source commit | Samples / raw records | Construction rows | Classification and retained reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `adaptive-send-turn-local-20260723-c1-abba-rerun-002` | `18a792ffc9a477cb8e452a65b2b03470b05210ec` | 4 / 8; all payload-valid | 0 | `invalid_environment`; target and generator health invalid, maximum within-treatment relative range `0.20145001529357126`. The then-current runner still withheld construction export after the environment failure. |
| `adaptive-send-turn-local-20260723-c1-abba-rerun-003` | `fb9d6782651bee6d0594e316b2375e0689a10ead` | 4 / 8; all payload-valid | 0 | `invalid_environment`; target and generator health invalid, maximum relative range `0.10069728847618635`. Its retained console log records the positional PowerShell argument-binding failure for `ExpectedPolicy`. |
| `adaptive-send-turn-local-20260723-c1-abba-rerun-004` | `86b7744e0a3bc966158102ef819349a432feabfa` | 4 / 8; all payload-valid | 8 | `neutral_local`; automatically exported and validated after the named-splat fix. Maximum relative range `0.049935014487130155`; target and generator health are `limited` because the topology remains same-host. |

The `rerun-004` root is
`C:\shared\src\incursa\quic-dotnet\.artifacts\adaptive-runtime\adaptive-send-turn-local-20260723-c1-abba-rerun-004\duplex-64kb-x1-s16`.
Its `evidence-validation.json` reports eight unique construction rows, one
checksum inventory, forty-four unique artifact hashes, and zero failures. The
validation summary SHA-256 is
`27259465a443a56ab9122a2715e372c5f831d612f060b1c3b02ba7b6cd09d513`.
The command used the same bounded c1 ABBA shape as the original cell with the
`rerun-004` campaign ID and source commit `86b7744e`; its retained console log
is `.artifacts\adaptive-runtime\adaptive-send-turn-local-20260723-c1-abba-rerun-004.runner-console.log`.

Commit `86b7744e` changes only runner argument binding: construction exporter
and evidence-validator parameters are named PowerShell splats rather than
positional arrays. Commit `f0be4875` verifies that two exclusion flags are
passed through that named-splat contract. The focused requirement home passed
6/6 after the latter commit.

## Remaining Gate

Repeat bounded c1/c4 local forced cells from the corrected runner on an
environment that satisfies the health/noise contract, then proceed only through
the reviewed multi-host campaign path. This record does not erase, supersede,
or pool the invalid same-host regime with a future eligible cohort.
